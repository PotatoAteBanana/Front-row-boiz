## The p-value is 0.736 - the association is not statistically significant.

# This is the odds of low birth rate for a woman of age 0. 
# This is not a clinically meaningful number, and gives us a warning 
# that the algebraic assumption underlying this model 
# (that each year of increased maternal age has a multiplicative effect on 
# the odds of low birth rate) may not be valid for extreem examples
